# Background Context
"Fix My Code" is not your typical coding project. It involves working with an existing codebase, and you may encounter code written in languages you are familiar with or those you've never seen before. The project repository, 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge, contains the initial files for all solutions. The primary goal is to fix the code rather than rewriting it from scratch.

This project is entirely optional and not mandatory. However, completing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. While your overall score won't be affected if you choose not to participate, exceeding your current average on this project might positively impact your grades. Enjoy the challenge!
